1. Dynamic Programming is an algorithmic paradigm that solves a given complex problem by breaking it into subproblems and stores the results of subproblems to avoid computing the same results again.

2. Like Divide and Conquer, Dynamic Programming combines solutions to sub-problems. Dynamic Programming is mainly used when solutions of same subproblems are needed again and again. 

3. Following are the two main properties of a problem that suggest that the given problem can be solved using Dynamic programming:
	a. Overlapping Subproblems
		i. Memoization (Top Down): The memoized program for a problem is similar to the recursive version with a small modification that it looks into a lookup table before computing solutions.
		ii. Tabulation (Bottom Up)
	b. Optimal Substructure
